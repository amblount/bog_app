##First Sprint
I noticed a lot of repitition and taking the long way around creating the crud actions. It was unclear what the models were until about midway trough the challenge. Now that I know we are making only one model with all the CRUD actions I think I will try and implement a few rails pro-tips.

Start: 9:34

Break: 10:15 - 10:27

End: 10:36

##Second Sprint

Start: 10:40

End: 11:01

rails g controller Creature show new index edit
These are all the views that will be created with this command and the actions
[Lets read about generators](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/generators.html)

rails g scaffold Creature name:string description:text

This generated all of the basic CRUD actions and even formatted the data in a table. The bootstrap link was cool, but my formatting was really messy and I could not figure out how to apply a basic CSS container.
For sprint 3 I think I will try another generator maybe just a controller with the CRUD actions as parameters

##Third Sprint

Start: 11:08
